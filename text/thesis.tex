I would like to thank my advisor Mgr. Jakub Míšek for his valuable advice and guidance he has given me for this thesis. I would also like to thank him for starting the Peachpie project in the first place and bringing me on despite the disadvantages mentoring a student who is writing a bachelor thesis inherently brings. 

This thesis would also not be possible without the endless support of my parents, friends, and classmates and the endless encouragement of my girlfriend. All of them and practically everyone else who I had the pleasure to meet during my studies deserve an acknowledgment.

% Abstract (recommended length around 80-200 words; this is not a copy of your thesis assignment!)
\def\Abstract{%
The goal of this thesis is to design and implement support for generators within the Peachpie framework, a PHP to CIL compiler. Generators are the simplest form of methods that resume from the same state in which they returned earlier when called repeatedly. The reference PHP interpreter Zend engine supports generators natively. Due to that fact generators in PHP are support a number of features not usually seen in other languages. CIL on the other hand does not have a native support for generators. Therefore, languages build on top of CIL (e.g. C\#, F\#) have to implement them by other means such as by rewriting the original generator methods into state machines. In this thesis we will design and implement support for generators through semantic tree transformations. All that with the intention of keeping the maximum possible compatibility with reference PHP generators. We will also make a comparison to generators in C\# whose main implementation also uses CIL as a backend.
